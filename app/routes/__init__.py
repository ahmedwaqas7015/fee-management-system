Routes Package

This package contains all route handlers (views).
We organize routes into blueprints for better structure.

What are Routes?
- URLs that users can visit (like /dashboard, /students)
- Each route has a function that handles the request
- Returns HTML, JSON, or redirects

# Blueprints will be imported here as we create them
